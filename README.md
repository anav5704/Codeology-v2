![Hero Page Image](https://github.com/anav5704/Codeology-v2/blob/main/docs/codeology-v2.png)

This is a blogging website I had made which also has a section for web development-related quizzes and live projects. The quizzes are coded using JavaScript and the projects are embedded using a third-party site(Fiddle JS). The blogs were created and managed  using Netify CMS but I have switched to Frontmatter CMS. This is also the first time I bought a domain, .net.

## Technologies Used
- Astro JS
- TailwindCSS
- Fiddle JS

## Getting Started
First fork and clone the repo. Then run ```npm install``` to download all the dependencies. Once that is done, run ```npm start``` to view it on localhost.
