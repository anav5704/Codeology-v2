This is a blogging website I had made which also has a section for web development related quizzes and live projects. The quizzes are coded in  using JavaScript and the projects are embeded from a third party site(Fiddle JS). The blogs were created and managed  using Netify CMS but I hvae switeched to Frontmatter CMS.
